I’m a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Conversational AI Group](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University.
I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Minlie Huang](http://coai.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/hml).
<!-- Prior to joining CoAI, I received B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from Beihang University. -->

My interests are in natural language processing and deep learning. I am particularly interested in how we can build a robust and scalable AI system that can leverage diverse skills (e.g., retrieval, logical reasoning, and numerical reasoning) to aggregate possibly-heterogeneous information and answer natural language questions precisely regardless of their complexity. My recent work has focused on
+ Comprehensive exploitation of large-scale textual knowledge for multi-answer QA ([RECTIFY](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08544))
+ Neuro-symbolic approaches for complex discrete reasoning ([CANTOR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16482) & [MIMAX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07174))
+ Robust classification and text matching (e.g., paraphrase detection and natural language inference) ([AdvExpander](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9622188))
